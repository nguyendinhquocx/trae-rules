## Framework Philosophy

### Core Concepts

**Story-Driven Development** breaks down complex applications into manageable, user-focused stories. Each story represents a complete piece of functionality that delivers value to users.

**Key Principles:**
- **User-Centric**: Every story focuses on user value
- **Incremental**: Build functionality piece by piece
- **Validated**: Each story is thoroughly tested and verified
- **Documented**: Maintain comprehensive documentation throughout
- **Collaborative**: AI and human work together effectively

### Why This Approach Works

1. **Reduces Complexity**: Large projects become manageable chunks
2. **Improves Quality**: Validation at each step prevents issues
3. **Enables Iteration**: Easy to adjust based on feedback
4. **Maintains Focus**: Clear objectives for each development cycle
5. **Scales Effectively**: Process works for small and large projects

## Setup and Initialization

### Step 1: Project Setup

1. **Copy Framework Files**
   ```
   cp -r Contex1/ your-project-name/
   cd your-project-name/
   ```

2. **Initialize Git Repository** (recommended)
   ```
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial framework setup"
   ```

### Step 2: Define Project Context
