# Story-Driven Development Framework

A comprehensive framework for building any application with just one prompt using story-driven development methodology. This framework combines structured development processes with AI-assisted implementation to deliver high-quality software efficiently.

## Overview

This framework enables you to:
- Build complete applications from a single comprehensive prompt
- Follow a proven 7-step story-driven development process
- Maintain high code quality through structured validation
- Document and track progress systematically
- Scale from MVP to full-featured applications

```

## Quick Start

### 1. Project Initialization

1. **Copy this framework** to your project directory
2. **Fill out PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** with your specific:
   - Business requirements
   - Domain knowledge
   - User personas
   - Technical constraints
   - Success criteria

3. **Update project_plan.md** with:
   - Project overview
   - Initial story breakdown
   - Success metrics

4. **Define architecture.md** with:
   - Technology stack
   - System architecture
   - Integration points

### 2. AI Assistant Setup

1. **Provide the AI assistant** with all framework files as context
2. **Share your main prompt** describing what you want to build
3. **Let the AI** break down your prompt into manageable stories
4. **Follow the 7-step process** for each story

### 3. Development Process

For each story, follow this 7-step process:

1. **Story Analysis** - Break down requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Technical Design** - Plan implementation approach and architecture
3. **Implementation** - Write code following best practices
4. **Testing** - Verify functionality and edge cases
5. **Integration** - Ensure compatibility with existing code
6. **Documentation** - Update relevant documentation
7. **Validation** - Confirm story completion and quality

## Core Principles

### Story-Driven Development
- **Stories as Units**: Each feature is a complete, testable story
- **Incremental Progress**: Build functionality piece by piece
- **User-Centric**: Focus on user value and experience
- **Validation Gates**: Verify each story before proceeding

### Quality Standards
- **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable, well-documented code
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing at each step
- **Documentation**: Keep documentation current and useful
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications early

### AI Collaboration
- **Context Awareness**: AI understands business and technical context
- **Structured Process**: Follow proven development methodology
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation and review processes
- **Continuous Learning**: Capture lessons learned for future stories

## Framework Components

### CLAUDE.md
**Purpose**: Provides AI assistant with comprehensive context and instructions
**Contains**:
- Project context and business understanding
- Technical architecture and constraints
- Development process and quality standards
- Communication guidelines and expectations

### pair_programming.md
**Purpose**: Defines the collaborative development process
**Contains**:
- 7-step story development process
- Quality standards and validation criteria
- Communication protocols
- Emergency procedures and escalation

### PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
**Purpose**: Captures business requirements and domain knowledge
**Contains**:
- Business context and problem statement
- User personas and workflows
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Technical constraints and dependencies

### project_plan.md
**Purpose**: Manages project planning and story tracking
**Contains**:
- Project overview and phases
- Story templates and tracking
- Progress metrics and velocity
- Success criteria and milestones

### architecture.md
**Purpose**: Documents technical architecture and decisions
**Contains**:
- System architecture overview
- Technology stack and rationale
- Integration points and data flow
- Security and performance considerations

### technical_considerations.md
**Purpose**: Captures technical decisions and lessons learned
**Contains**:
- Implementation decisions and rationale
- Technical challenges and solutions
- Performance optimizations
- Future improvements and technical debt

## Usage Patterns

### For New Projects
1. Start with PROJECT_CONTEXT.md to define requirements
2. Use project_plan.md to break down into stories
3. Define architecture.md for technical foundation
4. Begin story-by-story development

### For Existing Projects
1. Analyze current state and document in architecture.md
2. Define remaining features as stories in project_plan.md
3. Update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md with current understanding
4. Continue with story-driven development

### For Feature Additions
1. Define new features as stories in project_plan.md
2. Update architecture.md if needed
3. Follow 7-step process for each story
4. Update documentation as you go

## Best Practices

### Story Definition
- **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Define what "done" means
- **User Value**: Each story should deliver user value
- **Testable**: Stories should be verifiable
- **Independent**: Minimize dependencies between stories

### Development Process
- **Follow the 7 Steps**: Don't skip validation steps
- **Document Decisions**: Capture rationale for future reference
- **Test Early**: Validate functionality as you build
- **Iterate**: Refine based on feedback and learning

### Quality Assurance
- **Code Reviews**: Review code for quality and standards
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and user acceptance testing
- **Documentation**: Keep documentation current and useful
- **Performance**: Monitor and optimize performance

## Success Metrics

### Development Velocity
- Stories completed per iteration
- Time from story start to completion
- Quality metrics (bugs, rework)

### Code Quality
- Code coverage and test quality
- Documentation completeness
- Technical debt accumulation

### User Value
- Feature adoption and usage
- User satisfaction and feedback
- Business metric improvements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Stories Too Large**
- Break down into smaller, more manageable pieces
- Focus on single user workflow or feature
- Ensure each story can be completed in reasonable time

**Technical Debt Accumulation**
- Regular refactoring stories
- Address technical debt proactively
- Balance feature development with maintenance

**Quality Issues**
- Strengthen validation steps
- Improve testing practices
- Review and update quality standards

**Communication Breakdown**
- Regular check-ins and status updates
- Clear documentation and decision tracking
- Escalation procedures for blockers
